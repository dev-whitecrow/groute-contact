        <h2 id="1-automatic-collection-of-information">1. Automatic collection of information</h2>
        <p>When you use the Mobile Application, our servers automatically record information that your device sends. This data may include information such as your device's IP address and location, device name and version, operating system type and version, language preferences, information you search for in the Mobile Application, access times and dates, and other statistics.</p>
        <ul>
        <li> <strong>Camera and Photo Data:</strong> When you use the in-app camera feature, we access your device's camera to capture photos for travel documentation purposes. These photos are processed locally on your device and may be stored securely in cloud storage services (Firebase) operated by Google for backup, synchronization, and account recovery purposes.</li>
        <li> <strong>Location Information:</strong> We collect precise location data from photo metadata (EXIF data) when you capture or import photos. This location information is used exclusively to automatically map your travel journey and create location-based travel records on an interactive map powered by Google Maps.</li>
        <li> <strong>Photo Gallery Access:</strong> When you choose to import existing photos from your device gallery, we access only the photos you specifically select for your travel documentation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Information collected automatically is used only to identify potential cases of abuse and establish statistical information regarding the usage of the Mobile Application and Services. This statistical information is not otherwise aggregated in such a way that would identify any particular User of the system.</p>

        <h2 id="2-collection-of-personal-information">2. Collection of personal information</h2>
        <p>You can access and use the Mobile Application and Services without telling us who you are or revealing any information by which someone could identify you as a specific, identifiable individual. If, however, you wish to use some of the features offered in the Mobile Application, you may be asked to provide certain Personal Information (for example, your name and email address).</p>
        <p>We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us when you create an account, publish content, or fill any forms in the Mobile Application. When required, this information may include the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Account details</strong> (such as user name, unique user ID, password, etc)</li>
            <li><strong>Contact information</strong> (such as email address, phone number, etc)</li>
            <li><strong>Basic personal information</strong> (such as name, country of residence, etc)</li>
            <li><strong>Geolocation data</strong> of your device (such as latitude and longitude)</li>
            <li><strong>Certain features on the mobile device</strong> (such as contacts, calendar, gallery, etc)</li>
            <li><strong>Information about other individuals</strong> (such as your family members, friends, etc)</li>
            <li><strong>Any other materials</strong> you willingly submit to us (such as articles, images, feedback, etc)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can choose not to provide us with your Personal Information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of some of the features in the Mobile Application. Users who are uncertain about what information is mandatory are welcome to contact us.</p>

        <h2 id="3-use-and-processing-of-collected-information">3. Use and processing of collected information</h2>
        <p>We act as a data controller and a data processor when handling Personal Information, unless we have entered into a data processing agreement with you in which case you would be the data controller and we would be the data processor.</p>
        <p>Our role may also differ depending on the specific situation involving Personal Information. We act in the capacity of a data controller when we ask you to submit your Personal Information that is necessary to ensure your access and use of the Mobile Application and Services. In such instances, we are a data controller because we determine the purposes and means of the processing of Personal Information.</p>
        <p>We act in the capacity of a data processor in situations when you submit Personal Information through the Mobile Application and Services. We do not own, control, or make decisions about the submitted Personal Information, and such Personal Information is processed only in accordance with your instructions. In such instances, the User providing Personal Information acts as a data controller.</p>
        <p>In order to make the Mobile Application and Services available to you, or to meet a legal obligation, we may need to collect and use certain Personal Information. If you do not provide the information that we request, we may not be able to provide you with the requested products or services. Any of the information we collect from you may be used for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Create and manage user accounts</li>
            <li>Send administrative information</li>
            <li>Send product and service updates</li>
            <li>Respond to inquiries and offer support</li>
            <li>Request user feedback</li>
            <li>Improve user experience</li>
            <li>Enforce terms and conditions and policies</li>
            <li>Protect from abuse and malicious users</li>
            <li>Respond to legal requests and prevent harm</li>
            <li>Run and operate the Mobile Application and Services</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Processing your Personal Information depends on how you interact with the Mobile Application and Services, where you are located in the world and if one of the following applies: (a) you have given your consent for one or more specific purposes; (b) provision of information is necessary for the performance of this Policy with you and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof; (c) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which you are subject; (d) processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in us; (e) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party. We may also combine or aggregate some of your Personal Information in order to better serve you and to improve and update our Mobile Application and Services.</p>
        <p>Note that under some legislations we may be allowed to process information until you object to such processing by opting out, without having to rely on consent or any other of the legal bases. In any case, we will be happy to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Information is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.</p>

        <h2 id="4-managing-information">4. Managing information</h2>
        <p>You are able to delete certain Personal Information we have about you. The Personal Information you can delete may change as the Mobile Application and Services change. When you delete Personal Information, however, we may maintain a copy of the unrevised Personal Information in our records for the duration necessary to comply with our obligations to our affiliates and partners, and for the purposes described below. If you would like to delete your Personal Information or permanently delete your account, you can do so on the settings page of your account in the Mobile Application or simply by contacting us.</p>

        <h2 id="5-disclosure-of-information">5. Disclosure of information</h2>
        <p>Depending on the requested Services or as necessary to complete any transaction or provide any Service you have requested, we may share your non-personally identifiable information with our contracted companies, and service providers (collectively, "Service Providers") we rely upon to assist in the operation of the Mobile Application and Services available to you and whose privacy policies are consistent with ours or who agree to abide by our policies with respect to your information. We will not share any information with unaffiliated third parties.</p>
        <p>Service Providers are not authorized to use or disclose your information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or comply with legal requirements. Service Providers are given the information they need only in order to perform their designated functions, and we do not authorize them to use or disclose any of the provided information for their own marketing or other purposes. We will share and disclose your information only with the following categories of Service Providers:</p>

        <p>We may also disclose any Personal Information we collect, use or receive if required or permitted by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or similar legal process, and when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.</p>

        <h2 id="6-retention-of-information">6. Retention of information</h2>
        <p>We will retain and use your Personal Information for the period necessary to comply with our legal obligations, as long as your user account remains active, to enforce our Policy, resolve disputes, and unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.</p>
        <p>We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal Information after you update or delete it, but not in a manner that would identify you personally. Once the retention period expires, Personal Information shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to access, the right to erasure, the right to rectification, and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after the expiration of the retention period.</p>

        <h2 id="7-data-analytics">7. Data analytics</h2>
        <p>Our Mobile Application and Services may use third-party analytics tools that use cookies, web beacons, or other similar information-gathering technologies to collect standard internet activity and usage information.

        <h2 id="8-privacy-of-children">8. Privacy of children</h2>
        <p>We do not knowingly collect any Personal Information from children under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, please do not submit any Personal Information through the Mobile Application and Services. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Information to us through the Mobile Application and Services, please contact us to request that we delete that child's Personal Information from our Services.</p>
        <p>We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing their children never to provide Personal Information through the Mobile Application and Services without their permission. We also ask that all parents and legal guardians overseeing the care of children take the necessary precautions to ensure that their children are instructed to never give out Personal Information when online without their permission.</p>

These Social Media Features may collect your IP address, what page you are visiting on our Mobile Application and Services, and may set a cookie to enable Social Media Features to function properly. Social Media Features are hosted either by their respective providers or directly on our Mobile Application and Services. Your interactions with these Social Media Features are governed by the privacy policy of their respective providers.</p>

        <h2 id="10-email-marketing">10. Email marketing</h2>
        <p>We offer electronic newsletters to which you may voluntarily subscribe at any time.

However, you will continue to receive essential transactional emails.</p>

        <h2 id="11-push-notifications">11. Push notifications</h2>
        <p>We offer push notifications to which you may also voluntarily subscribe at any time. To make sure push notifications reach the correct devices, we rely on a device token unique to your device which is issued by the operating system of your device. While it is possible to access a list of device tokens, they will not reveal your identity, your unique device ID, or your contact information to us. We will maintain the information sent via email in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. If, at any time, you wish to stop receiving push notifications, simply adjust your device settings accordingly.</p>

        <h2 id="12-links-to-other-resources">12. Links to other resources</h2>
        <p>The Mobile Application and Services contain links to other resources that are not owned or controlled by us. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other resources or third parties. We encourage you to be aware when you leave the Mobile Application and Services and to read the privacy statements of each and every resource that may collect Personal Information.</p>

        <h2 id="13-information-security">13. Information security</h2>
        <p>No data transmission over the Internet or wireless network can be guaranteed. Therefore, while we strive to protect your Personal Information, you acknowledge that (a) there are security and privacy limitations of the Internet which are beyond our control; (b) the security, integrity, and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and the Mobile Application and Services cannot be guaranteed; and (c) any such information and data may be viewed or tampered with in transit by a third party, despite best efforts.</p>
        <p>As the security of Personal Information depends in part on the security of the device you use to communicate with us and the security you use to protect your credentials, please take appropriate measures to protect this information.</p>

        <h2 id="14-data-breach">14. Data breach</h2>
        <p>In the event we become aware that the security of the Mobile Application and Services has been compromised or Users' Personal Information has been disclosed to unrelated third parties as a result of external activity, including, but not limited to, security attacks or fraud, we reserve the right to take reasonably appropriate measures, including, but not limited to, investigation and reporting, as well as notification to and cooperation with law enforcement authorities. In the event of a data breach, we will make reasonable efforts to notify affected individuals if we believe that there is a reasonable risk of harm to the User as a result of the breach or if notice is otherwise required by law. When we do, we will post a notice in the Mobile Application, send you an email.</p>

        <h2 id="15-changes-and-amendments">15. Changes and amendments</h2>
